## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

## 📌 About

**Auth_App** is a modular, secure, and scalable authentication provider designed to be a plug-and-play solution for any application requiring user authentication and authorization.

Built with flexibility in mind, Auth_App offers a wide range of features including JWT-based authentication, OAuth2 social logins, role-based access control, email verification, and password reset flows. Whether you're building a SaaS platform, mobile backend, or internal admin tool, Auth_App can serve as your central identity and access management system.

It’s inspired by services like **Auth0** and **Firebase Auth**, but gives you full control over your user data, logic, and integrations — all while remaining open-source and extensible.
